- **manual_deploy** - Manual deployment activities
- **manual_fix** - Emergency fixes and hotfixes  
- **revert** - Rollbacks and reverts
- **env_setup** - Environment configuration work
- **restart** - Service restarts/reboots

## 📊 Example Output

```
Scanning /myproject for toil patterns...
✅ Found 15 toil events

Breakdown:
  manual_deploy: 6
  manual_fix: 4
  restart: 3
  env_setup: 2

## 🌟 Why This Matters

**30% of engineering time is spent on toil** - manual, repetitive work that provides no lasting value. This tool helps you:

1. **Identify** where your engineering time is going
2. **Discover** automation opportunities  
3. **Quantify** operational overhead
4. **Make informed** DevOps decisions

## 🎯 What It Actually Does

**Detects & Visualizes:**
- Manual deployment patterns
- Repetitive fixes and hotfixes
- Environment setup work
- Service restarts/reboots
- Rollbacks and reverts

**Then you decide where to automate based on the insights.**

## 🛠️ Development Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amrutp24/toil-tracker
cd toil-tracker
pip install -e .
```

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Scan your repos** - Find your team's toil patterns
2. **Share findings** - Show colleagues the automation opportunities
3. **Automate the top 3** - Tackle highest-frequency toil first
4. **Track improvement** - Use dashboard to measure progress
